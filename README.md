# EasyAttend

EasyAttend is a full-stack mobile application designed to simplify attendance tracking for hosts and attendees. The app enables hosts to generate a unique QR code for a specific event, which attendees can then scan to register their presence. This provides a secure, real-time, and two-factor registration system.

- **Real-time Registration**: Attendance is recorded instantly upon a successful scan, providing hosts with real-time updates.
- **Geofencing**: To ensure authenticity, attendance registration is restricted by location. Users must be within a predetermined radius of the event's location to successfully check in.
