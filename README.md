# EasyAttend

EasyAttend is a full-stack mobile application designed to simplify attendance tracking for hosts and attendees. The app enables hosts to generate a unique QR code for a specific event, which attendees can then scan to register their presence. This provides a secure, real-time, and two-factor registration system.
