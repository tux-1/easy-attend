# EasyAttend

EasyAttend is a full-stack mobile application designed to simplify attendance tracking for hosts and attendees. The app enables hosts to generate a unique QR code for a specific event, which attendees can then scan to register their presence. This provides a secure, real-time, and two-factor registration system.

# Key Features

- **QR Code Generation**: Hosts can generate a unique QR code for each session or event.
- **QR Code Scanning**: Attendees can quickly and easily scan the QR code using their device's camera to record their attendance.
- **Real-time Registration**: Attendance is recorded instantly upon a successful scan, providing hosts with real-time updates.
- **Geofencing**: To ensure authenticity, attendance registration is restricted by location. Users must be within a predetermined radius of the event's location to successfully check in.
